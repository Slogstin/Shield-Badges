    "Our employees were hard at work, trying to reverse engineer those little Shield Cores.
    But once they did it, everyone got up and the design process for our Shield Badges started!
    We sadly had to sacrifice a good chunk of their shield capacity, but don't worry, they NEVER
    stop recharging! (Unless they're full...)
    Whether it's chip damage or that one point blank jackboot that's always there for some reason,
    with this badge clipped to your shirt you'll likely be A-OK!
    Just try to not get pummeled by more that one or two goons at once. Got it?"
